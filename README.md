I am deeply interested in the interactions that occur belowground and how these feed into larger community and ecosystem dynamics. I am currently investigating how the depth at which plants grow their roots respond to climate change in peatlands, using minirhizotron images gathered from the SPRUCE experiment in northern Minnesota.

During my PhD, I investigated the trade of carbon and phosphorus between plants and their arbuscular mycorrhizal partners. Specifically, I was interested in how functional differences among plant and mycorrhizal species affected the allocation of these resources.
