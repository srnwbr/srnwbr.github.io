I am a plant and fungal ecologist, deeply interested in how biological interactions within and between these groups of organisms influence the composition of communities and drive nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Since my bachelors, I have at different times fixated on various aspects of interactions between plants and fungi. A major throughline has been plant roots and the mycorrhizal fungi who inhabit them. Plant roots serve as a major conduit of carbon from the atmosphere to the soil (which is the largest store of carbon on land). Mycorrhizal fungi are symbionts of 

I am currently investigating how the depth at which plants grow their roots respond to climate change in peatlands, using minirhizotron images gathered from the SPRUCE experiment in northern Minnesota.

During my PhD, I investigated the trade of carbon and phosphorus between plants and their arbuscular mycorrhizal partners. Specifically, I was interested in how functional differences among plant and mycorrhizal species affected the allocation of these resources.
